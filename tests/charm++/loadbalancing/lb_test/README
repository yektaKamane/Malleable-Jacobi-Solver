Information on the Load Balancing Framework
         Test Program

This program tests out the various strategies
used for load balancing.  The basic configuration
is a ring of Array elements who do some computation, 
then send a "compute" message to the next
element of the ring.  Computation proceeds
in parallel across all members of the ring
(main() calls each element's "compute" to
start everything going).

Note:
	To compile this program, you'll need
to link with the Metis library, on NCSA machines
at ~milind/libmetis.a.  The only way I know
to do that is to use charmc -verbose to get the
command line, then paste ~milind/libmetis.a 
in at the end.
