\section{Overview}

Mesh Streamer is a library for optimization of many-to-many and
all-to-all collective communication patterns in Charm++
applications. The library performs topological routing and aggregation
of network communication in the context of a virtual mesh topology
comprising the Charm++ Processing Elements (PEs) in the parallel
run. The number of dimensions and their sizes within this topology are
specified by the user when initializing an instance of the library.

Mesh Streamer is implemented as a Charm++ group, so an \emph{instance}
of Mesh Streamer has one object on every PE used in the run. We use
the term \emph{local instance} to denote a member of the Mesh Streamer
group on a particular PE. 

Most collective communication patterns involve sending linear arrays
of a single data type. In order to more efficiently aggregate and
process network data, Mesh Streamer restricts the data sent using the
library to a single data type specified by the user through a template
parameter when initializing an instance of the library. We use the
term \emph{data item} to denote a single object of this datatype
submitted to the library for sending. While the library is active
(i.e. after initialization and before termination), an arbitrary
number of data items can be submitted to the library at each PE.

Due to the underlying assumption of a mesh topology, the
benefits of Mesh Streamer are most pronounced on systems with a mesh
or torus network topology, where the virtual mesh of PEs is made to
match the physical topology of the network. The latter can easily be
accomplished using the Charm++ Topology Manager.

%\textbf{proposed
%  addition: provide a way to automatically determine virtual topology
%  dimensions based on physical topology, so that the user need not
%  worry about Topology Manager.}

The next two sections explain the routing and aggregation techniques
used in the library.

\subsection{Routing}

Let the variables $j$ and $k$ denote PEs within an N-dimensional
virtual topology of PEs and $x$ denote a dimension of the mesh. We
represent the coordinates of $j$ and $k$ within the mesh as $\left
(j_0, j_1, \ldots, j_{N-1} \right) $ and $ \left (k_0, k_1, \ldots,
k_{N-1} \right) $.  Also, let
\[
f(x, j, k) = 
\begin{cases} 
0, & \text{if } j_x = k_x \\
1, & \text{if } j_x \ne k_x
\end{cases}
\]

$j$ and $k$ are \emph{peers} if 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{d=0}^{N-1} f(d, j, k) = 1 .
\label{eq:peer}
\end{equation}
When using Mesh Streamer, PEs communicate directly only with their
peers. Sending to a PE which is not a peer is handled inside the
library by routing the data through one or more \emph{intermediate
  destinations} along the route to the \emph{final destination}.

Suppose a data item destined for PE $k$ is submitted to the library at
PE $j$. If $k$ is a peer of $j$, the data item will be sent directly
to $k$, possibly along with other data items for which $k$ is the
final or intermediate destination.  If $k$ is not a peer of $j$, the
data item will be sent to an intermediate destination $m$ along the
route to $k$ whose index is $\left (j_0, j_1, \ldots, j_{i-1}, k_i,
j_{i+1}, \ldots, j_{N-1} \right)$, where $i$ is the greatest value of
$x$ for which $f(x, j, k) = 1$.

Note that in obtaining the coordinates of $m$ from $j$, exactly one of
the coordinates of $j$ which differs from the coordinates of $k$ is
made to agree with $k$. It follows that m is a peer of $j$, and that
using this routing process at $m$ and every subsequent intermediate
destination along the route eventually leads to the data item being
received at $k$. Consequently, the number of messages $F(j, k)$ that
will carry the data item to the destination is
\begin{equation}
F(j,k) = \sum_{d=0}^{N-1}f(d, j, k) .
\label{eq:nummsgs}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Aggregation}

Communicating over the network of a parallel machine involves per
message bandwidth and processing overhead. Mesh Streamer amortizes
this overhead by aggregating data items at the source and every
intermediate destination along the route to the final destination.

Every local instance of the Mesh Streamer group buffers the data items
that have been submitted locally or received from another PE for
forwarding. Because only peers communicate directly in the virtual
mesh, it suffices to have a single buffer per PE for every
peer. Given a dimension d within the virtual topology, let $s_d$
denote its \emph{size}, or the number of distinct values a coordinate
for dimension d can take. Consequently, each local instance allocates
up to $s_d - 1 $ buffers per dimension, for a total of
$\sum_{d=0}^{N-1} (s_d - 1) $ buffers. Buffers are of a constant
size. This size can either be specified directly by the user when
creating the Mesh Streamer instance or, when using an alternative
constructor, specified indirectly through a parameter denoting the
maximum number of data items to be buffered at any point in time per
local instance of the library.  This amount is multiplied by a
constant \emph{overallocation factor} inside the library and divided
by the number of peers when determining the size of each
buffer. To prevent data allocation for peers which rarely or never
communicate, Mesh Streamer allocates buffers on demand as soon as a
data item needs to be sent out to a particular peer.

Sending with Mesh Streamer is done by submitting a data item and a
destination identifier, either PE or array index, using a function
call to the local instance.  If the index belongs to a peer, the
library places the data item in the buffer for the peer's
PE. Otherwise, the library calculates the index of the intermediate
destination using the previously described algorithm, and places the
data item in the buffer for the resulting PE, which by design is
always a peer of the local PE. Buffers are sent out immediately
when they become full. When a message is received at an intermediate
destination, the data items comprising it are distributed into the
appropriate buffers for subsequent sending. In the process, if a data
item is determined to have reached its final destination, it is
immediately returned to the user through a virtual function reserved
for that purpose.

The total buffering capacity specified by the user may be reached even
when no single buffer is completely filled up. In that case the buffer
with the greatest number of buffered data items is sent.

%In the context of this document, a data item is a piece
%of data sent in application code using Mesh Streamer. We do not use
%the term message in this context to indicate that a data item does not
%contain an envelope. Data items are aggregated into messages inside
%the library. Aggregation is done on a per-dimension basis, as
%described below.

%Each PE can be represented using its coordinates in the N-dimensional
%topology as $ \left (i_0, i_1, \ldots, i_{N-1} \right) $. A PE
%communicates directly with PEs whose coordinates match its own in all
%but one of the dimensions. 

%Let $s_d$, for $ d \in 0 \ldots N - 1$
%denote the number of PEs along dimension d in the topology. Buffers
%are allocated on demand when needed - initially no buffers are
%allocated. Consequently, each PE will allocate up to $s_d - 1 $
%buffers per dimension, for a total of $ \sum_{d=0}^{N-1} (s_d - 1) $
%buffers.

%Items are typically delivered to intermediate PEs along the route to
%the destination. At each intermediate destination, received items are
%sorted into correct messages for subsequent sending. Consider an item
%$a$ submitted at PE $ \left (j_0, j_1, \ldots, j_{N-1} \right) $ for
%destination PE $ \left (k_0, k_1, \ldots, k_{N-1} \right) $. Let
%\[
%f(x) = 
%\begin{cases} 
%0, & \text{if } j_x = k_x \\
%1, & \text{if } j_x \ne k_x
%\end{cases}
%\]

%The number of messages along which $a$ will travel is
%$\sum_{d=0}^{N-1}f(d)$. Sending an item involves comparing the index
%of the destination PE (where the item is to be delivered) to the index
%of the current PE, starting from the right. The first coordinate in
%the destination PE index thus encountered which is not equal to the
%corresponding coordinate in the source PE is substituted into the
%source PE index to obtain the next PE along the route of the item. The
%item is then placed in the appropriate buffer for the resulting index
%(if the buffer does not exist, it is created).

%As an example, a PE in a 3D mesh is a member of some row, column, and
%plane, representing the mesh dimensions. Each PE contains a single
%buffer for every index

\section{Application User Interface}

A typical usage scenario for Mesh Streamer involves a start-up phase
followed by one or more \emph{streaming steps}. We next describe the
interface and details relevant to usage of the library, which normally
follows these steps:
 
\begin{enumerate}
\item{\textbf{Start-up}} Creation of a Mesh Streamer group of an
  appropriate type and set up of client arrays and groups
\item{\textbf{Initialization}} Calling an appropriate initialization
  function, which returns through a callback
\item{\textbf{Sending}} An arbitrary number of sends using the
  insertData function call
\item{\textbf{Receiving}} Processing received data items through the
  virtual \emph{process} function which serves as the delivery
  interface for the library and must be defined by the user
\item{\textbf{Termination}} Termination of a streaming step
\item{\textbf{Reinitialization}} Chare migration, potentially followed
  by reinitialization of Mesh Streamer (step 2) for a new streaming step
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Start-Up}

Start-up is typically performed once in a program, often inside the
Main function of the mainchare, and involves creating the Mesh
Streamer group.

An instance of Mesh Streamer is restricted to sending data items of a
single user-specified type, which we denote by \emph{dtype}, to a
single user-specified chare array or group. The target group or array
should inherit from MeshStreamerGroupClient\textless{}dtype\textgreater{} and
MeshStreamerArrayClient\textless{}dtype, itype\textgreater{}, respectively.

%\textbf{proposed change:
%  remove client inheritance to simplify the interface. This will have
%  the effect of removing support for anytime migration.} 


\subsubsection{Sending to a Group}
To use Mesh Streamer for sending to a group, a GroupMeshStreamer group
should be created. Either of the following two GroupMeshStreamer
constructors can be used for that purpose:

\begin{alltt}
template <class dtype>
GroupMeshStreamer<dtype>::GroupMeshStreamer(
                  int maxNumDataItemsBuffered, 
                  int numDimensions, 
                  int *dimensionSizes, 
                  const CProxy_MeshStreamerGroupClient<dtype>& clientProxy, 
                  bool yieldFlag = 0, 
                  double progressPeriodInMs = -1.0); \\
template <class dtype>
GroupMeshStreamer<dtype>::GroupMeshStreamer(
                  int numDimensions, 
                  int *dimensionSizes, 
                  const CProxy_MeshStreamerGroupClient<dtype>& clientProxy, 
                  int bufferSize, 
                  bool yieldFlag = 0, 
                  double progressPeriodInMs = -1.0);

\end{alltt}

\subsubsection{Sending to a Chare Array}
For sending to a chare array, an ArrayMeshStreamer group should be
created, which has a similar constructor interface to GroupMeshStreamer:

\begin{alltt}
template <class dtype, class itype>
ArrayMeshStreamer<dtype, itype>::ArrayMeshStreamer(
                  int maxNumDataItemsBuffered, 
                  int numDimensions,
                  int *dimensionSizes, 
                  const CProxy_MeshStreamerArrayClient<dtype>& clientProxy,
                  bool yieldFlag = 0, 
                  double progressPeriodInMs = -1.0); \\
template <class dtype, class itype>
ArrayMeshStreamer<dtype, itype>::ArrayMeshStreamer(
                  int numDimensions, 
                  int *dimensionSizes, 
                  const CProxy_MeshStreamerArrayClient<dtype>& clientProxy,
                  int bufferSize, 
                  bool yieldFlag = 0, 
                  double progressPeriodInMs = -1.0);

\end{alltt}

Description of parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item maxNumDataItemsBuffered: maximum number of items that the
  library is allowed to buffer per PE 
\item numDimensions: number of dimensions in mesh of PEs
\item dimensionSizes: array of size numDimensions containing the size
  of each dimension in the mesh
\item clientProxy: the proxy for the destination array or group
\item bufferSize: size of the buffer for each peer,
  in terms of number of data items
\item yieldFlag: when true, calls CthYield() after every 1024 item
  insertions - setting it true requires all data items to be submitted
  from threaded entry methods - ensures that pending messages are sent
  out by the runtime system - useful when a large number of data items
  are submitted from a single entry method,
\item progressPeriodInMs: number of milliseconds in between periodic
  flushes of all internal buffers, relevant only when periodic
  flushing is enabled (see section on termination)
\end{itemize}

template parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item dtype: data item type
\item itype: index type of client chare array (use int for
  CkArrayIndex1D and CkArrayIndex for all other index types)
\end{itemize}

The group or array which receives data sent using Mesh Streamer needs
to inherit from MeshStreamerGroupClient<dtype> or
MeshStreamerArrayClient<dtype>.

\subsection{Initialization}

Before any sending can be done, the library needs to be
initialized. There are currently two main modes of operation,
depending on the type of termination used: staged completion and
completion detection. The modes of termination are described
later. Here, we present the interface for intializing a streaming step
in each case.

When using completion detection, each local instance of Mesh Streamer
must be initialized using the following init function:

\begin{alltt}
void MeshStreamer<dtype>::init(
                  int numContributors,
                  CkCallback startCb, 
                  CkCallback endCb, 
                  CProxy_CompletionDetector detector, 
                  int prio, bool usePeriodicFlushing);
\end{alltt}

Description of parameters:

\begin{itemize}
\item numContributors: number of \emph{done} calls expected globally
  before termination of this streaming step
\item startCb: callback to be invoked by the libray after
  initialization is complete
\item endCb: callback to be invoked by the library after termination
  of this streaming step
\item detector: an inactive CompletionDetector object
\item prio: Charm++ prority to be used for messages sent using Mesh
  Streamer in this streaming step
\item usePeriodicFlushing: specifies whether periodic flushing should
  be used for this streaming step
\end{itemize}

When using staged completion, a completion detector object is not
required as input, as the library performs its own specialized form of
termination. In this case, each local instance of Mesh Streamer must
be initialized using a different interface for the overloaded init function: 

\begin{alltt}
void MeshStreamer<dtype>::init(
                  int numLocalContributors, 
                  CkCallback startCb, 
                  CkCallback endCb, 
                  int prio, bool usePeriodicFlushing);
\end{alltt}

Note that numLocalContributors denotes the local number of done calls
expected, rather than the global as in the first interface of init. In
practice, this often precludes calling this version of init through a
broadcast, as the desired number of done calls may be different on
each PE.

A common case is to have a single chare array perform all the sends in
a streaming step, with each element of the array as a contributor. For
this case there is a special version of init that takes as input the
CkArrayID object for the chare array that will perform the sends: 

\begin{alltt}
void MeshStreamer<dtype>::init(
                  CkArrayID senderArrayID,
                  CkCallback startCb, 
                  CkCallback endCb, 
                  int prio, bool usePeriodicFlushing);
\end{alltt}

After initialization is finished, the system invokes startCb,
signalling to the user that the library is ready to accept data items
for sending. 
\\

%\textbf{proposed addition: add a non-streaming all-to-all interface,
%  which should not require an init call}

\subsection{Sending}

Sending with Mesh Streamer is done through calls to insertData and broadcast. 

\begin{alltt}
void GroupMeshStreamer<dtype>::insertData(
                       const dtype &dataItem, 
                       int destinationPe);
\end{alltt}

\begin{alltt}
void ArrayMeshStreamer<dtype, itype>::insertData(
                       const dtype &dataItem,
                       itype arrayIndex);
void MeshStreamer<dtype>::broadcast(const dtype& dataItem);
\end{alltt}

\begin{itemize}
\item dataItem: reference to a data item to be sent
\item destinationPe: index of destination PE
\item arrayIndex: index of destination array element
\end{itemize}

Broadcasting has the effect of delivering the data item:
\begin{itemize}
\item {once on every PE involved in the computation for GroupMeshStreamer}
\item {once for every array element involved in the computation for
       ArrayMeshStreamer}
\end{itemize}

%\textbf{proposed addition: add an interface for sending an array of
%  data items}

\subsection{Receiving}

To receive data items sent using Mesh Streamer, the user must define
the process function for each client group and array:

\begin{alltt}
void MeshStreamerGroupClient<dtype>::process(const dtype &dataItem);
void MeshStreamerArrayClient<dtype>::process(const dtype &dataItem);
\end{alltt}

process is called by the library on the destination processor once for
every delivered item.

\subsection{Termination}

A termination mechanism is required due to the buffering of data items
in Mesh Streamer local instances at the source and intermediate
destinations. Without a flushing or termination mechanism, data items
may remain buffered indefinitely without ever getting delivered to
their final destinations. A termination scheme ensures that these
items are delivered, preventing deadlock. 

Currently, two means of termination are supported, staged completion
and completion detection. Periodic flushing is a secondary mechanism
which can be enabled or disabled when initiating one of the primary
mechanisms. 

In general, termination requires the user to issue a number of calls
to the \emph{done} function:
\begin{alltt}
 void MeshStreamer<dtype>::done(int numContributorsFinished = 1);
\end{alltt}
When using completion detection, the number of done calls that are
expected globally by the Mesh Streamer instance is specified using the
numContributors parameter to init. Safe termination requires that no
calls to insertData or broadcast are made after the last call to
\emph{done} is performed globally. Because order of execution is
uncertain in parallel applications, some care is required to ensure
the above condition is met. A simple way to terminate safely is to set
numContributors equal to the number of senders, and call done once for
each sender that is done sending.

In contrast to using completion detection, using staged completion
involves setting the local number of expected done calls on each local
instance using the numLocalContributors parameter in the init
function. To ensure safe termination, no insertData or broadcast calls
should be made on any PE that has received all its expected done
calls. 

The final overloaded version of init, which takes a CkArrayID object as an
argument, provides a simplified interface in the common case when a
single chare array performs all the sends within a streaming step,
with each of its elements as a contributor. This version of init
determines the appropriate number of local contributors automatically
and can be called through a broadcast. It also correctly handles
the case of PEs without any contributors by immediately marking those
PEs as having finished the streaming step. As such, this version of init
should be preferred by the user when applicable. 

The choice of which termination mechanism to use is left to the
user. There are cases where it may be easier to use the completion
detection scheme. If either mode can be used with ease, staged
completion should be preferred, as it achieves termination faster and
does not involve the persistent overhead of completion detection due
to reductions for determining when the global number of expected done
calls is reached. Staged completion, unlike completion detection, does
incur a small bandwidth overhead (4 bytes) for every Mesh Streamer
message, but in practice this is more than offset by the persistent
traffic incurred by completion detection. 

Periodic flushing is an auxiliary mechanism which checks at a regular
interval whether any sends have taken place since the last time the
check was performed. If not, the mechanism sends out all the data
items buffered per local instance of the library. The period is
specified by the user in the Mesh Streamer constructor. A typical use case
for periodic flushing is when the submission of a data item A to
Mesh Streamer happens as a result of the delivery of another data item B
sent using the same Mesh Streamer instance. If B is buffered inside the library
and insufficient data items are submitted to cause the buffer holding
B to be sent out, a deadlock could arise. With the periodic flushing
mechanism, the buffer holding B is guaranteed to be sent out
eventually, and deadlock is prevented.

%Staged completion is a termination mechanism with one stage per
%dimension of the topology. The end result of each stage is a flush,
%which sends the messages for PEs that lie along the particular
%dimension. In the context of the following discussion, a dimension d
%is outer compared to dimension d' if the coordinate for dimension d is
%to the right of the coordinate for dimension d' within an
%index. Likewise, dimension d' in this case would be inner compared to d.
%Flushes proceed from the ``outermost'' dimension to the
%``innermost'' dimension. The flush for the ``outermost'' dimension is
%carried out as soon as a \emph{done} call is received from all
%producers local to that PE. 
%A flush is carried out when it has been determined that all
%the messages along 


%aggregated along the dimension.  A staged
%completion over an N-dimensional mesh produces N flushes at each
%PE. 

%A flush is the sending of all
%buffered data 

% of termination, with a
%stage for flushing along each dimension. 


%orderly manner of termination where
%at each PE data is flushed in order from ``outermost'' to
%``innermost'' dimensions.

\subsection{Reinitialization}

A Mesh Streamer instance that has terminated cannot be used for
sending more data items until it has been
reinitialized. Reinitialization is achieved by calling init, which
prepares the instance of the library for a new streaming
step. Reinitialization is useful for time stepped applications. A new
streaming step is normally done for each step of the application.

Many applications perform load balancing between time steps. Mesh
Streamer supports using load balancing in this fashion as long as
migrations are not performed during a streaming step.

A potential performance issue when using ArrayMeshStreamer with load
balancing is that it bypasses the automatic array location updates
performed by the runtime system. As such, when an array element is
migrated, most data items submitted for sending to that destination
will be routed to the wrong PE, and only then sent using the default
Charm++ mechanism to the correct PE. To make matters worse, this does
not not lead to the original sender finding out the correct updated
location, leading to serious performance degradation. 



%Updates of chare location data are normally performed in lazy fashion
%by the Charm++ runtime system. When a message is delivered to a PE
%where the destination chare no longer resides, a forwarding mechanism
%finds the correct destination PE and sends it the message, but also
%sends a control message back to the sender with the updated location
%data.  When using Mesh Streamer, destination PEs are determined at the
%PE where a data item is submitted to the library. A data item that
%reaches its destination PE may

To fix this problem, Charm++ should be compiled with
-DCMK\underline{\hspace{.2cm}}GLOBAL
\underline{\hspace{.2cm}}LOCATION\underline{\hspace{.2cm}}UPDATE for
applications which use Mesh Streamer and load balancing. The option
has the effect of performing a global broadcast of location data for
every chare array that is migrated. Unfortunately, this operation is
expensive when migrating large numbers of elements. A better workaround
is in development.
