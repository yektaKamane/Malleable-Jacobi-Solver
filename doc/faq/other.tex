\subsection{What is Structured Dagger?}

{\em Structured Dagger} is a structured notation for specifying intra-process
control dependencies in message-driven programs. It combines the efficiency
of message-driven execution with the explicitness of control specification.
Structured Dagger allows easy expression of dependencies among messages
and computations and also among computations within the same object using
{\tt when-blocks}
and various structured constructs. See the Charm++ manual for the details.

\subsection{What is Adaptive MPI?}

Adaptive MPI (AMPI) is an implementation of the MPI standard on top of Charm++.
This allows MPI users recompile their existing MPI applications on AMPI's compiler
wrappers to take advantage of Charm++'s high level features, such as overdecomposition,
overlap of communication and computation, dynamic load balancing, and fault tolerance.
See the AMPI manual for more details on how AMPI works and how to use it.

\subsection{What is Charisma?}

Charisma++ is a prototype language for describing global view of control in a parallel program. It is designed to solve the problem of obscured control flow in the object-based model with Charm++.

\subsection{Does Projections use wall time or CPU time?}

Wall time.
