Doxygen comes with Redhat7.2 and has already been installed on all new group Linux machines.

Here is the steps for generating config file:

1) doxygen -g <config>  --> generates config file

2) vi <config>  --> change some settings

3) doxygen <config>  --> actually build the docs


Here charm.conf is a sample config file that read charm from /www/charm and output documentation to /www/doxygen.
