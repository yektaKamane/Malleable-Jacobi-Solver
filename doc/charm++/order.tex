\subsection{Delivery Order}

By default, \charmpp\ will process the messages you send in roughly
FIFO\index{message delivery order} order when they arrive at a PE.
For most programs, this behavior is fine.  However, for optimal
performance, some programs need more explicit control over the order
in which messages are processed. \charmpp\ allows you to adjust
delivery order on a per-message basis.

% Example general use cases here

\subsubsection{Queueing Strategies}
\label{queueing strategies}

The simplest call available to change the order in which messages
are processed is \kw{CkSetQueueing}.

\function{void CkSetQueueing(MsgType message, int queueingtype)}

where \uw{queueingtype} is one of the following constants:

\begin{alltt}
  CK_QUEUEING_FIFO
  CK_QUEUEING_LIFO
  CK_QUEUEING_IFIFO
  CK_QUEUEING_ILIFO
  CK_QUEUEING_BFIFO
  CK_QUEUEING_BLIFO
  CK_QUEUEING_LFIFO
  CK_QUEUEING_LLIFO
\end{alltt}

The first two options,  \kw{CK\_QUEUEING\_FIFO} and
\kw{CK\_QUEUEING\_LIFO}, are used as follows:

\begin{alltt}
  MsgType *msg1 = new MsgType ;
  CkSetQueueing(msg1, CK_QUEUEING_FIFO);

  MsgType *msg2 = new MsgType ;
  CkSetQueueing(msg2, CK_QUEUEING_LIFO);

  CkEntryOptions opts1, opts2;
  opts1.setQueueing(CK_QUEUEING_FIFO);
  opts2.setQueueing(CK_QUEUEING_LIFO);

  chare.entry_name(arg1, arg2, opts1);
  chare.entry_name(arg1, arg2, opts2);
\end{alltt}

When message \kw{msg1} arrives at its destination, it will be pushed
onto the end of the message queue as usual.  However, when \kw{msg2}
arrives, it will be pushed onto the {\em front} of the message
queue. Similarly, the two parameter-marshalled calls to \kw{chare}
will be inserted at the end and beginning of the message queue,
respectively.

\subsubsection{Prioritized Execution}
\label{prioritized message passing}
\index{prioritized execution}
\index{prioritized message passing}
\index{priorities}

The basic FIFO and LIFO strategies are sufficient to approximate
parallel breadth-first and depth-first explorations of a problem
space, but they don't admit more fine-grained control. To provide that
degree of control, \charmpp\ also allows explicit prioritization of
messages.

The other six queueing strategies involve the use of
priorities\index{priorities}.  There are two kinds of priorities which
can be attached to a message: {\sl integer priorities}\index{integer
  priorities} and {\sl bitvector priorities}\index{bitvector
  priorities}. These correspond to the {\em I} and {\em B} queueing
strategies, respectively. In both cases, numerically lower priorities
will be dequeued and delivered before numerically greater
priorities. The FIFO and LIFO queueing strategies then control the
relative order in which messages of the same priority will be
delivered.

To attach a priority field to a
message, one needs to set aside space in the message's buffer while
allocating the message\index{message priority}.  To achieve this, the
size of the priority field\index{priority field} in bits should be
specified as a placement argument to the \kw{new} operator, as
described in Section \ref{memory allocation}.  Although the size of
the priority field is specified in bits, it is always padded to an
integral number of {\tt int}s.  A pointer to the priority part of the
message buffer can be obtained with this call:

\function{void *CkPriorityPtr(MsgType msg)}
\index{CkPriorityPtr}
\index{priority pointer}

Integer priorities are quite straightforward.  One allocates a message
with an extra integer parameter to ``new'' (see the first line of the
example below), which sets aside enough space (in bits) in the message
to hold the priority.  One then stores the priority in the message.
Finally, one informs the system that the message contains an integer
priority using \kw{CkSetQueueing}:

\begin{alltt}
  MsgType *msg = new (8*sizeof(int)) MsgType;
  *(int*)CkPriorityPtr(msg) = prio;
  CkSetQueueing(msg, CK_QUEUEING_IFIFO);
\end{alltt}

Integer proiorities for parameter-marshalled messages can be achieved
through {\tt CkEntryOptions::setPriority()}:

\begin{alltt}
  CkEntryOptions opts;
  opts.setPriority(7);
  chare.entry_name(arg1, arg2, opts);
\end{alltt}

Bitvector priorities are somewhat more complicated.  Bitvector
priorities are arbitrary-length bit-strings representing fixed-point
numbers in the range 0 to 1.  For example, the bit-string ``001001''
represents the number .001001\raisebox{-.5ex}{\scriptsize binary}.  As
with the simpler kind of priority, higher numbers represent lower
priorities.  Unlike the simpler kind of priority, bitvectors can be of
arbitrary length, therefore, the priority numbers they represent can
be of arbitrary precision.

Arbitrary-precision priorities\index{arbitrary-precision priorities}
are often useful in AI search-tree applications.  Suppose we have a
heuristic suggesting that tree node $N_1$ should be searched before
tree node $N_2$.  We therefore designate that node $N_1$ and its
descendants will use high priorities, and that node $N_2$ and its
descendants will use lower priorities.  We have effectively split the
range of possible priorities in two.  If several such heuristics fire
in sequence, we can easily split the priority range \index{priority
range splitting} in two enough times that no significant bits remain,
and the search begins to fail for lack of meaningful priorities to
assign.  The solution is to use arbitrary-precision priorities,
i.e. bitvector priorities.

To assign a bitvector priority, two methods are available.  The
first is to obtain a pointer to the priority field using  \kw{CkPriorityPtr},
and then manually set the bits using the bit-setting operations
inherent to C.  To achieve this, one must know the format
\index{bitvector format} of the
bitvector, which is as follows: the bitvector is represented as an
array of unsigned integers.  The most significant bit of the first
integer contains the first bit of the bitvector.  The remaining bits
of the first integer contain the next 31 bits of the bitvector.
Subsequent integers contain 32 bits each.  If the size of the
bitvector is not a multiple of 32, then the last integer contains 0
bits for padding in the least-significant bits of the integer.

The second way to assign priorities is only useful for those who are
using the priority range-splitting\index{priority range splitting}
described above.  The root of the tree is assigned the null
priority-string.  Each child is assigned its parent's priority with
some number of bits concatenated.  The net effect is that the entire
priority of a branch is within a small epsilon of the priority of its
root.

It is possible to utilize unprioritized messages, integer priorities,
and bitvector priorities in the same program.  The messages will be
processed in roughly the following order\index{multiple priority types}:

\begin{itemize}

\item Among messages enqueued with bitvector priorities, the
messages are dequeued according to their priority.  The
priority ``0000...'' is dequeued first, and ``1111...'' is
dequeued last.

\item Unprioritized messages are treated as if they had the
priority ``1000...'' (which is the ``middle'' priority, it
lies exactly halfway between ``0000...'' and ``1111...'').

\item Integer priorities are converted to bitvector priorities.  They
are normalized so that the integer priority of zero is converted to
``1000...'' (the ``middle'' priority).  To be more specific, the
conversion is performed by adding 0x80000000 to the integer, and then
treating the resulting 32-bit quantity as a 32-bit bitvector priority.

\item Among messages with the same priority, messages are
dequeued in FIFO order or LIFO order, depending upon which
queuing strategy was used.

\end{itemize}

Additionally, {\sl long integer priorities} can be specified by the {\em L} strategy. 

A final reminder about prioritized execution: \charmpp\ processes
messages in {\it roughly} the order you specify; it never guarantees
that it will deliver the messages in {\it precisely} the
order\index{message delivery order} you specify. Thus, the correctness
of your program should never depend on the order in which the runtime
delivers messages. However, it makes a serious attempt to be
``close'', so priorities can strongly affect the efficiency of your
program.

\subsubsection{Skipping the Queue}

Some operations that one might want to perform are sufficiently
latency-sensitive that they should never wait in line behind other
messages. The \charmpp\ runtime offers two attributes for entry
methods, {\kw expedited} and {\kw immediate}, to serve these
needs. For more information on these attributes, see
Section~\ref{attributes} and the example in {\tt
  charm/pgms/charm++/megatest/immediatering.C}.
