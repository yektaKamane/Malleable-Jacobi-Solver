\subsection{PUP}

\label{sec:pup}

The \index{PUP} PUP framework is a generic way to describe the data in an object and to use that description for any task requiring serialization.
The \charmpp\ system can use this description to pack the object 
into a message, and unpack the message into a new object on another 
processor. 
The name thus is a contraction of the words Pack and UnPack (PUP). 

Like many \CC\ concepts, the PUP framework is easier to use than 
describe: 

\begin{alltt}
class foo : public mySuperclass \{
 private:
    double a;
    int x;
    char y;
    unsigned long z;
    float arr[3];
 public:
    ...other methods...

    //pack/unpack routine: describe my fields to charm++
    void pup(PUP::er &p) \{
      mySuperclass::pup(p);
      p|a;
      p|x; p|y; p|z;
      PUParray(p,arr,3);
    \}
\};
\end{alltt}

This class's pup routine describes the fields of a \uw{foo} to \charmpp{}.
This allows \charmpp\ to: marshall parameters of type \uw{foo} across processors,
translate \uw{foo}s across processor architectures, read and write \uw{foo}s
to disk files, inspect and modify \uw{foo} objects in the debugger, and 
checkpoint and restart calculations involving \uw{foo}s.



\subsubsection{PUP contract}

Your object's pup routine must save and restore all your object's data.
As shown, you save and restore a class's contents by writing a routine
called ``pup'' which passes all the parts of the class to an object of type
\index{PUP::er} \kw{PUP::er}, which does the saving or restoring.  
We often use ``pup'' as a verb, meaning ``to save/restore the value of''
or equivalently, ``to call the pup routine of''.

Pup routines for complicated objects normally call the pup routines
for their simpler parts.  Since all objects depend on their immediate
superclass, the first line of every pup routine is a call to the 
superclass's pup routine---the only time you shouldn't call your superclass's
pup routine is when you don't have a superclass.  If your superclass has
no pup routine, you must pup the values in the superclass yourself.


\paragraph{PUP operator}

\label{sec:pupstl}

The recommended way to pup any object \verb.a. is to use \verb.p|a;..
This syntax is an operator \verb.|. applied to the \kw{PUP::er} \verb.p.
and the user variable \verb.a..

The \verb.p|a;. syntax works wherever a is:

\begin{itemize}
 \item A simple type, including char, short, int, long, float, or double.
    In this case, \verb.p|a;. copies the data in-place.
    This is equivalent to passing the type directly to the \kw{PUP::er}   
       using \verb.p(a)..
 \item Any object with a pup routine.
    In this case, \verb.p|a;. calls the object's pup routine.
    This is equivalent to the statement \kw{a.pup(p);}. 
 \item A pointer to a PUP::able object, as described in Section~\ref{sec:pup::able}.
    In this case, \verb.p|a;. allocates and copies the appropriate subclass.
 \item An object with a \kw{PUPbytes}(\uw{myClass}) declaration in the header.
    In this case, \verb.p|a;. copies the object as plain bytes, like memcpy.
 \item An object with a custom \verb.operator |. defined.
    In this case, \verb.p|a;. calls the custom \verb.operator |..
\end{itemize}

For container types, you must simply pup each element of the container.
For arrays, you can use the utility routine \kw{PUParray}, which takes
the \kw{PUP::er}, the array base pointer, and the array length.
This utility routine is defined for user-defined types T as:
  \begin{alltt}
    template<class T>
    inline void PUParray(PUP::er &p,T *array,int length) \{
       for (int i=0;i<length;i++) p|array[i];
    \}
  \end{alltt}

If the variable is from the C++ Standard Template Library, you can include 
operator\verb.|.'s for STL vector, map, list, pair, and string, templated
on anything, by including the header ``pup\_stl.h''.

As usual in \CC{}, pointers and allocatable objects usually require special handling. 
Typically this only requires a \kw{p.isUnpacking()} conditional block, 
where you perform the appropriate allocation.  See 
Section~\ref{sec:pupdynalloc} for more information and examples.  

If the object does not have a pup routine, and you cannot add one or use 
PUPbytes, you can define an operator\verb.|. to pup the object.
For example, if \uw{myClass} contains two fields \uw{a} and \uw{b}, the 
operator\verb.|. might look like:

\begin{alltt}
  inline void operator|(PUP::er &p,myClass &c) \{
    p|c.a;
    p|c.b;
  \}
\end{alltt}


\paragraph{PUP as bytes}

\label{sec:pupbytes}

For classes and structs with many fields, it can be tedious and 
error-prone to list all the fields in the pup routine.
You can avoid this listing in two ways, as long as the
object can be safely copied as raw bytes---this is normally 
the case for simple structs and classes without pointers.

\begin{itemize}
\item Use the \verb.PUPbytes(myClass). macro in your header file.
      This lets you use the \verb.p|*myPtr;. syntax 
      to pup the entire class as sizeof(myClass) raw bytes.

\item Use \verb.p((void *)myPtr,sizeof(myClass));. in the pup 
      routine.  This is a direct call to pup a set of bytes. 
      
\item Use \verb.p((char *)myCharArray,arraySize);. in the pup 
      routine.  This is a direct call to pup a set of bytes. 
	  Other primitive types may also be used.
      
\end{itemize}

Note that pupping as bytes is just like using `memcpy': 
it does nothing to the data but copy it whole.
For example, if the class contains any pointers, you
must make sure to do any allocation needed, and
pup the referenced data yourself.

Pupping as bytes will prevent your pup routine from 
ever being able to work across different machine 
architectures.  We don't do this very often yet, but 
eventually may, so pupping as bytes is currently discouraged.



\paragraph{PUP overhead}

\label{sec:pupoverhead}

The \kw{PUP::er} overhead is very small---one virtual function call
for each item or array to be packed/unpacked.  The actual packing/unpacking is
normally a simple memory-to-memory binary copy. 

For arrays of builtin types like ``int" and ``double", or arrays of a type 
with the ``PUPbytes'' declaration, \kw{PUParray} uses an even faster block 
transfer, with one virtual function call per array.


\paragraph{PUP structured dagger}

\label{sec:pupsdag}

Please note that if your object contains Structured Dagger code (see section~\ref{sec:sdag}) you must call the generated routine \kw{\_\_sdag\_pup} to correctly pup the Structured Dagger state:

\begin{alltt}
class bar : public barParent \{
 public:
    bar_SDAG_CODE 
    ...other methods...

    virtual void pup(PUP::er& p) \{
      barParent::pup(p);
      __sdag_pup(p);
      ...pup other data here...
    \}
\};
\end{alltt}



\paragraph{PUP modes}

\label{sec:pupmodes}

\charmpp{} uses your pup routine to both pack and unpack, 
by passing different types of \kw{PUP::er}s to it.  The routine
\kw{p.isUnpacking()} returns true if your object is being unpacked---that 
is, your object's values are being restored.  Your pup routine must
work properly in sizing, packing, and unpacking modes; and
to save and restore properly, the same fields must be passed 
to the \kw{PUP::er}, in the exact same order, in all modes.
This means most pup routines can ignore the pup mode.

Three modes are used, with three separate types of \kw{PUP::er}: 
sizing, which only computes the size of your data without modifying it;
packing, which reads/saves values out of your data; and unpacking,
which writes/restores values into your data.  You can determine
exactly which type of \kw{PUP::er} was passed to you using the
\kw{p.isSizing()}, \kw{p.isPacking()}, and \kw{p.isUnpacking()}
routines. However, sizing and packing should almost always be 
handled identically, so most programs should use \kw{p.isUnpacking()}
and \kw{!p.isUnpacking()}.  Any program that calls \kw{p.isPacking()} 
and does not also call \kw{p.isSizing()} is probably buggy, because
sizing and packing must see exactly the same data.


The \kw{p.isDeleting()} flag indicates the object will be deleted
after calling the pup routine.  This is normally only needed for
pup routines called via the C or f90 interface, as provided by 
AMPI or the FEM framework.  Other \charmpp{} array elements, 
marshalled parameters, and other C++ interface objects 
have their destructor called when they are deleted, so the 
\kw{p.isDeleting()} call is not normally required---instead,
memory should be deallocated in the destructor as usual.


\subsubsection{Life Cycle}

\label{sec:lifecycle}

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=6.0in]{fig/pup}
\end{center}
\caption{Life cycle of an object with a pup routine.}
\label{fig:pup}
\end{figure}

The life cycle of an object with a pup routine is shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:pup}.  As usual in \CC{}, objects are 
constructed, do some processing, and are then destroyed.

Objects can be created in one of two ways: they can
be created using a normal constructor as usual; or they
can be created using their pup constructor.  The pup constructor
for \charmpp{} array elements and \kw{PUP::able} objects
is a ``migration constructor'' that takes a single ``CkMigrateMessage *";
for other objects, such as parameter marshalled objects,
the pup constructor has no parameters.  The pup constructor
is always followed by a call to the object's pup routine in
\verb.isUnpacking. mode.

Once objects are created, they respond to regular user methods
and remote entry methods as usual.  At any time, the object 
pup routine can be called in \verb.isSizing. or \verb.isPacking.
mode.  User methods and sizing or packing pup routines can be called
repeatedly over the object lifetime.

Finally, objects are destroyed by calling their destructor
as usual.
