\label{Distribution}

While we can promise neither bug-free software nor immediate solutions   
to all problems, \charmpp\ is a stable system and it is our intention to
keep it as up-to-date and usable as our resources will allow
by responding quickly to questions and bug reports.  To that
end, there are mechanisms in place for contacting Charm users
and developers. 

Our software is made available for research use and evaluation.
For the latest software distribution, further information about {\sc
Charm}/\charmpp\ and information on how to contact the Parallel
Programming laboratory, see our website at {\it
http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/}.  The software is also available by
anonymous ftp, from a.cs.uiuc.edu, under the directory
pub/research-groups/CHARM.  

If retrieval of a publication via these channels is not possible,
please send electronic mail to {\tt kale@cs.uiuc.edu} or postal mail to:
