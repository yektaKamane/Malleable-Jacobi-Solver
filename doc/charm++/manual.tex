\title{The\\ \charmpp\\ Programming Language\\ Manual} \version{6.0
  (Release 1)} \credits{ {\small The Charm software was developed as a
    group effort.  The earliest prototype, Chare Kernel(1.0), was
    developed by Wennie Shu and Kevin Nomura working with Laxmikant
    Kale.  The second prototype, Chare Kernel(2.0), a complete
    re-write with major design changes, was developed by a team
    consisting of Wayne Fenton, Balkrishna Ramkumar, Vikram Saletore,
    Amitabh B. Sinha and Laxmikant Kale. The translator for Chare
    Kernel(2.0) was written by Manish Gupta.  Charm(3.0), with
    significant design changes, was developed by a team consisting of
    Attila Gursoy, Balkrishna Ramkumar, Amitabh B.  Sinha and
    Laxmikant Kale, with a new translator written by Nimish Shah.  The
    \charmpp\ implementation was done by Sanjeev Krishnan.  Charm(4.0)
    included \charmpp\ and was released in fall 1993.  Charm(4.5) was
    developed by Attila Gursoy, Sanjeev Krishnan, Milind Bhandarkar,
    Joshua Yelon, Narain Jagathesan and Laxmikant Kale.  Charm(4.8),
    developed by the same team included Converse, a parallel runtime
    system that allows interoperability among modules written using
    different paradigms within a single application. \charmpp\ runtime
    system was re-targetted at Converse. Syntactic extensions in
    \charmpp\ were dropped, and a simple interface translator was
    developed (by Sanjeev Krishnan and Jay DeSouza) that, along with
    the \charmpp\ runtime, became the \charmpp\ language.  Charm
    (5.4R1) included the following: a complete rewrite of the
    \charmpp\ runtime system (using \CC) and the interface translator
    (done by Milind Bhandarkar), several new features such as Chare
    Arrays (developed by Robert Brunner and Orion Lawlor), various
    libraries (written by Terry Wilmarth, Gengbin Zheng, Laxmikant
    Kale, Zehra Sura, Milind Bhandarkar, Robert Brunner, and Krishnan
    Varadarajan.) A coordination language ``Structured Dagger'' was
    been implemented on top of \charmpp\ (Milind Bhandarkar), dynamic
    seed-based load balancing (Terry Wilmarth and Joshua Yelon), a
    client-server interface for Converse programs, and debugging
    support by Parthasarathy Ramachandran, Jeff Wright, and Milind
    Bhandarkar, Projections, the performance visualization and
    analysis tool, was redesigned and rewritten using Java by Michael
    Denardo. The test suite for \charmpp\ was developed by Michael
    Lang, Jackie Wang, and Fang Hu. Converse was been ported to ASCI
    Red (Joshua Yelon), Cray T3E (Robert Brunner), and SGI Origin2000
    (Milind Bhandarkar). For the current version Charm 6.0 (R1),
    Converse has been ported to new platforms including BlueGene/[LP]
    (Kumar, Huang, Bhatele), Cray XT3/4 (Zheng), Apple G5, Myrinet
    (Zheng), and Infiniband (Chakravorty).  Charm 6.0 introduces a
    dedicated no network SMP multicore Converse layer for stand-alone
    workstation experimenters (Zheng, Chakravorty, Kale, Jetley).
    Charm 6.0 also includes cross platform network topology aware
    chare placement for 3D tori and mesh networks (Kumar, Huang,
    Bhatele, Bohm). The test suite was extended for automated testing
    on all supported platforms by Gengbin Zheng.  The Projection tool
    was substantially improved by Chee Wai Lee and Isaac Dooley. The
    Control Point performance tuning framework was created by Isaac
    Dooley. Debugging support was enhanced with memory inspection
    features by Filippo Gioachin. The Charisma orchestration language
    was implemented on top of Charm++ by Chao Huang and Sanjay Kale.
    Sanjay Kale, Orion Lawlor, Gengbin Zheng, Terry Wilmarth, Filippo
    Gioachin, Sayantan Chakravorty, Chao Huang, David Kunzman, Isaac
    Dooley, Eric Bohm, Sameer Kumar, Chao Mei, Pritish Jetley, and
    Abhinav Bhatele, have been responsible for the changes to the
    system since the last release.  } }
