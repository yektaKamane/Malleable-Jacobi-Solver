The following calls provide information about the mapping of physical hardware to
 the logical processing elements(PE) in Charm++.
A processing element (PE) refers to a single unit of mapping and scheduling,
whereas a physical node refers to an actual hardware node 
(or, more precisely, an operating system instance on which Charm++ processes execute,
 or, in networking terminology, a host).


Note that a physical node is different from a logical node. A logical node is a set of processing elements that share
one or more PEs. One may partition a physical node into multiple logical nodes.
In the implementation, a separate process exists for each logical node and all PEs within the logical node
 share the same memory address space.
In theory, communication between PEs in the same physical node is faster than communication
 between different physical nodes, since various interconnect layers can be bypassed.
PEs are ranked in range 0 to {\em CmiNumPes()}.

%\section{Physical Node API}

Charm++ provides a set of functions for querying information about the mapping of PE's to physical nodes. 
 Class cputopology.C, contains the following member functions:


\begin{description}
\item [int CmiPeOnSamePhysicalNode(int pe1, int pe2)] Returns 1 if PE's pe1 and pe2 are on the same physical node and 0 otherwise.

\item [int CmiNumPhysicalNodes()] Returns the number of physical nodes that the program is running on.

\item [int CmiNumPesOnPhysicalNode(int node)] Returns the number of PE's  that reside within a physical node.

\item [void CmiGetPesOnPhysicalNode(int node, int **pelist, int *num)] After execution pelist will point to a 
list of all PE's that reside within a physical node and num will point to the length of the list. One should be careful
to not free or alter pelist since it points to system memory.

\item [int CmiPhysicalRank(int pe)] Returns the rank of a PE among all PE's running on the same physical node.

\item [int CmiPhysicalNodeID(int pe)] Returns the node ID of the physical node in which a PE resides.

\item [int CmiGetFirstPeOnPhysicalNode(int node)]  Returns the lowest numbered processor on a physical node.
