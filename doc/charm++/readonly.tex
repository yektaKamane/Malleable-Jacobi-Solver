\subsection{Read-only Variables, Messages and Arrays}

\label{readonly}

Since \charmpp\ does not allow global variables for keeping programs portable
across a wide range of machines, it provides a special mechanism for sharing
data amongst all objects. {\it Read-only} variables, messages and arrays are
used to share information that is obtained only after the program begins
execution and does not change after they are initialized in the dynamic scope
of {\tt main::main()} function. They can be accessed from any
\index{chare}chare on any processor as ``global'' variables.When a variable is declared as read only,it is PUPped so that it can be accessed from any chare on any processor. Large data
structures containing pointers can be made available as read-only variables
using read-only messages or read-only arrays. Read-only variables, messages and
arrays can be used just like local variables for each processor, but the user
has to allocate space for read-only messages using \kw{new} to create the
message in the {\tt main} function of the \kw{mainchare}. 

Read-only variables, messages, and arrays are declared by using the type
modifier \kw{readonly}, which is similar to \kw{const} in \CC. Read-only data
is specified in the {\tt .ci} file (the interface file) as: 

\begin{alltt}
 readonly Type ReadonlyVarName;
\end{alltt}

The variable \uw{ReadonlyVarName} is declared to be a read-only variable of
type \uw{Type}. \uw{Type} must be a single token and not a type expression.

\begin{alltt}
 readonly message MessageType *ReadonlyMsgName;
\end{alltt}

The variable \uw{ReadonlyMsgName} is declared to be a read-only message of type
\uw{MessageType}. Pointers are not allowed to be readonly variables unless they
are pointers to message types. In this case, the message will be initialized on
every processor.

\begin{alltt}
 readonly Type ReadonlyArrayName [arraysize];
\end{alltt}

The variable \uw{ReadonlyArrayName} is declared to be a read-only array of type
\uw{Type}. \uw{Type} must be a single token and not a type expression.

Read-only variables, messages and arrays must be declared either as
global or as public class static data, and these declarations have the
usual form:

\begin{alltt}
 Type ReadonlyVarName;
 MessageType *ReadonlyMsgName;
 Type ReadonlyArrayName [arraysize];
\end{alltt}

Similar declarations preceded by \kw{extern} would appear in the {\tt
.h} file. 

{\it Note:}  The current \charmpp\ translator cannot prevent
assignments to read-only variables.  The user must make sure that no
assignments occur in the program.
