\subsubsection{Write a Measurement-based Object Migration Strategy}
\label{writelb}

Charm++ programmers can pick load balancing strategy from Charm++'s built-in
strategies~\ref{lbStrategy} for the best performance based on the 
characteristics of their applications, they can also choose to write their 
own load balancing strategies.

Charm++ load balancing framework provides a simple way to incorporate new 
load balancing strategies. To write a new load balancing strategy
involves the following steps (We use an example of writing a centralized
load balancer fooLB to illustrate the steps).

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create files named fooLB.ci, fooLB.h and fooLB.C. One can choose to
copy and rename the files RandCentLB of random centralized load balancer

\item Implement the fooLB class method --- fooLB::work(CentralLB::LDStats* stats, int count); This method takes the load balancing database as an input,
and output the new mapping of objects to processors.

\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Understand Load Balancing Database Data Structure}
\label{lbdatabase}

What information is measured during the runtime and how it is represented in
the load balancing database data structure?
