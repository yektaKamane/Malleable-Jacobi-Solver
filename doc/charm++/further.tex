\section{Further Information}

\subsection{Related Publications}
\label{publications}

For starters, see the publications and reports as well
as related manuals that can be found on the Parallel Programming
Laboratory website: \texttt{http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/}. 

\subsection{Associated Tools and Libraries}

Several tools and libraries are provided for \charmpp{}. \projections{} 
is an automatic performance analysis tool which provides
the user with information about the parallel behavior of \charmpp\ programs. 
The purpose of implementing \charmpp{} standard
libraries is to reduce the time needed to develop parallel
applications with the help of a set of efficient and re-usable modules.
Most of the libraries have been described in a separate manual.

\subsubsection{\projections}

\projections{} is a performance visualization and feedback tool. The system has
a much more refined understanding of user computation than is possible in
traditional tools.

\projections{} displays information about the request for creation and the
actual creation of tasks in \charmpp\ programs. Projections also provides the
function of post-mortem clock synchronization. Additionally, it can also
automatically partition the execution of the running program into logically
separate units, and automatically analyzes each individual partition. 

Future versions will be able to provide recommendations/suggestions for
improving performance as well.

\subsection{Contacts}
\label{Distribution}

While we can promise neither bug-free software nor immediate solutions   
to all problems, \charmpp\ is a stable system and it is our intention to
keep it as up-to-date and usable as our resources will allow
by responding quickly to questions and bug reports.  To that
end, there are mechanisms in place for contacting Charm users
and developers. 

Our software is made available for research use and evaluation.
For the latest software distribution, further information about
\converse{}/\charmpp\ and information on how to contact the Parallel
Programming laboratory, see our website at \texttt{http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/}.
The software is also available by
anonymous ftp, from a.cs.uiuc.edu, under the directory
pub/research-groups/CHARM.
