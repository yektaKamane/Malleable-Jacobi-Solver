\section{Node Topology}

The following calls provide information about the machines upon which the
parallel program is executing.  Processing Element refers to a single CPU.
Node refers to a single machine-- a set of processing elements which share
memory (i.e. an address space).  Processing Elements and Nodes are numbered,
starting from zero.

%Thus if a parallel program is executing on one 4-processor workstation and one
%2-processor workstation, there would be 6 processing elements (0, 1 ,2, 3, 4,
%and 5) but only 2 nodes (0 and 1).  A given node's processing elements are
%numbered sequentially.
