The following calls provide information about the machine upon which the
parallel program is executed. A processing element (PE) refers to a single CPU,
whereas a node refers to a single machine -- a set of processing elements that share
memory (i.e. an address space).  PEs and nodes are numbered separately starting
from zero, i.e., PEs are numbered in range $[0,CmiNumPes())$, and nodes are
numbered in range $[0,CmiNumNodes())$.

\section{Network Topology}
Charm++ provides a unified abstraction for querying topology of IBM's BG/L, BG/P
and BG/Q, and Cray's XT3, XT4, XT5 and XE6. Class TopoManager, which can be used 
by including TopoManager.h, contains following member functions:

\begin{description}
\item [TopoManager():] Default constructor.
\item [getDimNX(), getDimNY(), getDimNZ():] Returns the length of X, Y and Z
dimensions (except BG/Q).
\item [getDimNA(), getDimNB(), getDimNC(), getDimND(), getDimNE():] Returns the
length of A, B, C, D and E dimensions on BG/Q.
\item [getDimNT():] Returns the length of T dimension. TopoManager uses T
dimension to represent different cores that reside within a physical code.
\item [rankToCoordinates(int pe, int \&x, int \&y, int \&z, int \&t):] Get the
coordinates of PE with number {\em pe} (except BG/Q).
\item [rankToCoordinates(int pe, int \&a, int \&b, int \&c, int \&d, int \&e, int
\&t):] Get the coordinates of PE with number {\em pe} on BG/Q.
\item [coordinatesToRank(int x, int y, int z, int t):] Returns the number of PE
with given coordinates (except BG/Q).
\item [coordinatesToRank(int a, int b, int c, int d, int e, int t):] Returns the
number of PE with given coordinates on BG/Q.
\item [getHopsBetweenRanks(int pe1, int pe2):] Returns the distance between the
given PEs in terms of the hops count on the network between the two PEs.
\item [printAllocation(FILE *fp):] Outputs the allocation for a particular
execution to the given file.

\end{description}

%\section{Node Topology}

%Thus if a parallel program is executing on one 4-processor workstation and one
%2-processor workstation, there would be 6 processing elements (0, 1 ,2, 3, 4,
%and 5) but only 2 nodes (0 and 1).  A given node's processing elements are
%numbered sequentially.
