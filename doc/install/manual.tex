\section{Introduction}
In this manual, we describe how to install Charm, Charm++ and
Converse, how to compile and execute programs, and the available
command line options.  We also describe various queueing and load balancing
strategies, and the various modes of execution of Charm and Charm++
programs.  Details on the Interface Translator version of Charm++ are
in the appendix.
