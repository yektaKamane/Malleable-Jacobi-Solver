* Configuration

Configure with

	./configure *machtype*

where "*machtype*" is one of the supported target machines.  As of
May 1997, the makefiles were revamped, and they aren't quite up-to-date.
These are the machines for which we currently have working makefiles:

	axp-gcc      convex-hppa  i386-gcc-ss  setjmp-gcc   stub-gcc
	axp-osf1-cc  hppa-cc      ksr1-cc      solaris-cc
	axp-osf2-cc  i386-gcc     meerkat      solaris-gcc

However, there is also a vax version without a makefile, and several
of these versions can be trivially ported to other operating systems
with the same architecture by editing the makefiles.

* Build

To build the QuickThreads library, first configure (see above) then
type `make' in the top-level directory.  This also builds the
demonstration threads package, SimpleThreads, and the stress-test
program.

* Installation

Build the QuickThreads library (see above) and then copy `libqt.a' to
the installation library directory (e.g., /usr/local/lib) and `qt.h'
and `qtmd.h' to the installation include directory (e.g.,
/usr/local/include).
