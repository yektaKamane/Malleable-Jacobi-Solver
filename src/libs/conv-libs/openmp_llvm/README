LLVM OpenMP library integrated with Converse.

All the changes made in this project for the integration are enclosed with a flag, "CHARM_OMP"

BASE REVISION
=============
This library has been forked from LLVM OpenMP Library. 
(git: https://github.com/llvm-mirror/openmp, svn: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/openmp/trunk/)
The base revision is 278951 in svn, 75f264c1494a700ead3c0ea439e3445be8500c7a in git)

LIST OF MODIFIED FILES
======================
The following is the list of modified codes from the LLVM OpenMP library to make it work with Converse.
runtime/src/CMakeLists.txt
runtime/src/kmp.h
runtime/src/kmp_barrier.cpp
runtime/src/kmp_config.h.cmake
runtime/src/kmp_os.h
runtime/src/kmp_runtime.c
runtime/src/z_Linux_util.c

These files are modified to use old implementation of barriers in LLVM library. 
These codes in the base revision use C++11 atomic feature but many of Charm++ target compilers still don't provide full support for C++11.
Thus, we reverted the commit in the base repo(svn: 271324, git: e75e989062c302a64514f3328805221a98600c6c) so that the following codes don't use C++11 atomic feature.
runtime/src/kmp_dispatch.cpp
runtime/src/kmp_lock.cpp
runtime/src/kmp_lock.h

The following codes are added to plug the LLVM OpenMP library into the Converse. 
runtime/ompcharm/Makefile
runtime/ompcharm/OmpCharm.C
runtime/ompcharm/OmpCharm.ci
runtime/src/ompcharm.h

BUILD INSTRUCTION
=================
This library is built only with SMP mode of Charm++ or AMPI.
You can build this library with 'omp' keyword. 
e.g.) $(CHARMDIR)/build charm++ multicore-linux64 omp (This library is built with multicore version of Charm++: Single-node SMP version of Charm++) 
      $(CHARMDIR)/build charm++ netlrts-linux-x86_64 smp omp (This integrations is built with netlrts version in SMP mode.)

If you want to build this library again after the Charm++ or AMPI is built and you make some changes in the source codes, 
   you can rebuild this library incrementally by 'make openmp_llvm' in $(CHARMDIR)/tmp.
