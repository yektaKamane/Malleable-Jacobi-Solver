Synchronization Strategies for POSE
===================================

cons (Basic Conservative): relies on GVT for advancement; no lookahead, no
bells, no whistles [NOT MAINTAINED]

opt (Basic Optimistic): Performs events in best-first order on the processor,
one at a time

opt2 (Optimized Optimistic): Same as opt, but when an object gets control, it
will execute all events that have the same lowest timestamp

opt3 (Constrained Opt2): Same as opt2, but will not execute events beyond a
fixed speculative window

spec (Speculative Window): No attempt made at best-first ordering; when an
object gets control, it will execute all events within the fixed speculative
window 

adapt (Basic Adaptive): same as spec, only the size of the speculative window
changes based on rollback behavior: it starts at a min size, and expands by
one for every successful set of forward executions (up to a max size); when a
rollback occurs, speculative window size is reset to the minimum

adapt2 (Experimental Adaptive): changes to regular adapt reflecting what I'm
currently experimenting with...
