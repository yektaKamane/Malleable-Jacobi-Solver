This directory contains the configurations for compiling charm on cygwin.
Note This version of cygwin is still under testing.

To compile charm on cygwin:
1. install cygwin from: http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin
   with inetutils and w32api packages. TCSH need to be installed separately
   in order to run charm programs.  (tcsh doesn't come with the cygwin package,
   but can be found on the same web site) 

2. compile charm++:    ./SUPER_INSTALL charm++ net-cygwin

3. setting up running environment:
   setup /etc/inetd.conf and /etc/services to start rshd, 
   Here is an example of /etc/inetd.conf:

###
shell stream tcp nowait.1000  root /usr/sbin/in.rshd  in.rshd
###

   and an example of /etc/services:

###   
shell     514/tcp    cmd
###

3. before running charm program, start 'inetd' first to get rshd running.
