This is a 2D crack propagation application built on top of the
FEM framework.  This program is now OBSOLETE, as it uses an older
version of the FEM framework.


In order to compile the crack2d program, you need to just type "make"
in this directory. This wll make two programs: pgm and getmesh

getmesh is needed to prepare inputs for the program. Where as pgm is the
crack2d application.

After compilation, run:

# this will extract the mesh description from the input file crck_bar.inp
# and will put it in crck_bar.mesh

./getmesh

# this will convert the mesh in crck_bar.mesh to a graph in crck_bar.graph
# needed to do partitioning with metis

../../../../bin/mesh2graph crck_bar.mesh crck_bar.graph

# this will partition the graph in crck_bar.graph into 4 partitions
# and will create individual files meshdata.Pe* for each partition.

../../../../bin/gmap crck_bar.graph 4

# this will run the program pgm on 2 processors, by mapping 4 partitions
# onto these two processors. This program runs for 2000 iterations, and
# prints the time taken for each iteration at the end. Migration is
# performed after every 25 iterations. Note that the number of iterations can
# be changed in the cohesive.inp file.

./conv-host +p2 pgm +vp4

I have bigger data files available for this program. SO, if you are interested
in using those, you should contact me. (They are so big, I dont want to
check them in this directory.
