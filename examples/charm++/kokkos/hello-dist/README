Hello World with Kokkos (Distributed)

Demonstrates basic interoperability with Kokkos.
Paths to include and lib folders of Kokkos (KOKKOS_INC and KOKKOS_LIB, respecitvely)
need to be set as environment variables or provided to the Makefile.
Uses nodegroup to allow a separate instance of Kokkos to run on each process.
The tricky part is getting argc and argv fed correctly to Kokkos::initialize().
