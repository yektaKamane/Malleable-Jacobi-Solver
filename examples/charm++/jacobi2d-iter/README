Jacobi iteration with a 2D Array.

This code uses a 2-D blocked decomposition of a 2-d array with more
than one element per chare. The code runs for a specified number of
iterations, using a reduction to start each successive iteration.

A 5-point stencil pattern is used to update the value for each data
element. For example, the new value for element X is the current
value of X plus the current values of its left, right, top, and
bottom neighbors.

     T
   L X R
     B

X'  = (X + L + R + T + B) / 5.0


To run the program with liveviz, run the parallel job as shown in
runserver.sh, or just do a "./runserver.sh"

While the program is running, connect a visualization client to that
server. To do this you can run "charm/java/bin/liveViz localhost 1234"
Note that port 1234 is the port specified in runserver.sh. You should
at this point see a small window appear, with a black background, and
a 64x64 pixel blue rectangle in the upper left corner. The parallel
server job should also print out a series of lines whenever each worker
is requested to provide a portion of the frame. Resizing the client
window will cause the image to be requested again, but with a different
size.
