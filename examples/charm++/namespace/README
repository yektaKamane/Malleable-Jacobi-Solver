This is a demonstration of using namespaces and inheritance in Charm++.
The base class A is created in namespace Base, and a class B in namespace
Base::Derived is derived from A. The main chare, Driver, imports the
Base::Derived namespace to create a chare of type B, on which it then calls
a method defined in A and a method defined in B.

Note that the "using namespace" statement in Inherit.ci is not really
necessary--it could be moved to Inherit.cc. However, it would be needed in
the .ci file to inherit from a class inside a namespace.
